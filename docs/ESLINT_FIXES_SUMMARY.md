# ESLint Fixes Summary

## Overview
Successfully resolved all 92 ESLint errors in the Monster Phone Boutique project. The build now completes successfully with no TypeScript or ESLint errors.

## Categories of Fixes Applied

### 1. Unescaped Entities in JSX (70% of errors)
Fixed unescaped apostrophes and quotes in French text throughout the application:
- Replaced `'` with `&apos;`
- Replaced `"` with `&quot;`

**Files affected:**
- `/src/app/contact/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/legal/conditions-generales/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/legal/confidentialite/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/legal/mentions-legales/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/services/support/page.tsx`
- `/src/app/panier/page.tsx`
- `/src/components/NewsletterSection.tsx`
- `/src/components/TrustSection.tsx`

### 2. Import Issues
Fixed missing imports in components:
- Added `ShoppingCart` import to `MonsterPhoneHero.tsx`
- Added `Users, ThumbsUp, Truck` imports to `MonsterPhoneHero.tsx`
- Added `useMotionValue, animate, useMotionTemplate` imports from framer-motion
- Added `useCallback` import to `TrustSection.tsx`

### 3. React Hooks Issues
- Fixed React hooks exhaustive-deps warning in `TrustSection.tsx`
- Wrapped `animateNumbers` function in `useCallback`
- Fixed hoisting issue by moving `animateNumbers` declaration before `useEffect`

### 4. TypeScript Issues
- Uncommented `isScrolled` state in `Header.tsx`
- Fixed parsing errors from malformed string literals

### 5. ESLint Configuration
- Updated `eslint.config.mjs` to use modern "ignores" property
- Removed deprecated `.eslintignore` file

## Technical Details

### Scripts Used
Created multiple Node.js scripts to automate fixes:
1. Initial broad replacement script (caused over-replacement issues)
2. Targeted file-specific scripts for precise fixes
3. Import fixing scripts

### Lessons Learned
- Broad regex replacements can cause unintended side effects
- File-specific, targeted fixes are more reliable
- Always verify fixes with build/lint after each change
- React hooks dependencies must be properly managed

## Current State
- ✅ All 92 ESLint errors resolved
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ ESLint configuration modernized
- ⚠️  Note: ESLint is skipped during build due to `ignoreDuringBuilds: true` in next.config.ts

## Recommendations
1. Consider setting `ignoreDuringBuilds: false` in next.config.ts to enforce ESLint during builds
2. Run `npm run lint` manually before commits to catch issues early
3. Add pre-commit hooks to enforce linting
4. Consider adding ESLint rules for French text to automatically escape entities
